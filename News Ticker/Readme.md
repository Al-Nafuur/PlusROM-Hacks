# PlusROM News-Ticker

This is an early PoC to receive data from a PlusROM backend and display it as text. It is downloading data for a newsticker of www.t-online.de (a german news website). Pressing the joystick button will load the next 4 news from the backend.

The ASM code is based on the 36 character demo by Omegamatrix (last update May 11, 2018) https://atariage.com/forums/topic/278667-36-character-demo

But It doesn't look nice on a white background and I think I generally mixed some things up in the ASM code when I changed it to 3E bankswitching (3E because of the RAM to store the downloaded data).
