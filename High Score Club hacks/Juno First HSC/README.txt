This is the Final War - the Last Battle.  Transcending Time and Space, the 
outcome determines the fate of our Earth!  [Juno First Arcade Flyer]

INTRODUCTION

Juno First is an Atari 2600 version of the 1983 Konami arcade game of the 
same name.  The objective of the game is very simple: destroy the aliens, 
collect the astronauts, and survive for as long as possible!

USING THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLERS

Plug one joystick controller into the LEFT CONTROLLER port.  Press the 
joystick FIRE button to begin a new game.  During a game, hold the
joystick in the LEFT or RIGHT position to move your ship horizontally, and 
in the UP or DOWN position to move your ship forwards or backwards.
Pressing the Joystick FIRE button will shoot a laser beam from your ship.
To abandon a game and return to the title screen, press the RESET switch.

SCORING AND HYPERSPACE

Your score is based on the value of each alien that you destroy.  A table of
score values is shown on the game title screen.  There is also a time bonus 
which depends on the speed that each wave is cleared.

Shooting an alien sphere will release an astronaut.   Collect this astronaut 
before it leaves the screen to enter hyperspace.   In hyperspace, the aliens 
will stop firing, and the score for each alien that you shoot will increase.

SPARE SHIPS

At the beginning of the game you have two spare ships.   These ships are shown
underneath the score at the bottom of the screen.  An extra ship (up to a 
maximum of six) will be earned for every 10,000 points that you score.

FUEL

There is bar showing your remaining fuel at the bottom of the screen. When 
the fuel becomes empty, your ship will be destroyed.   Fuel is used at a 
constant rate, regardless of the movements of your ship.   You have 
approximately 60 seconds of fuel to complete each wave.

AUTOFIRE MODE

The game will enter "Autofire Mode" with the LEFT DIFFICULTY switch in
position B.  To activate autofire in this mode, simply hold down the FIRE 
button.

Autofire mode is disabled by moving the LEFT DIFFICULTY switch to position A.
With autofire disabled you can only fire 5 consecutive shots before the FIRE 
button must be released.

CONTINUE MODE

The game will enter "Continue Mode" with the RIGHT DIFFICULTY switch in 
position B.   In this mode, each new game will continue from the highest wave
reached in the previous game.   In this mode, the starting wave for the game 
can be changed by moving the joystick UP or DOWN on the title screen.  Pressing
SELECT on the title screen will also increase the starting wave.   Pressing 
RESET on the title screen will reset the game back to the first wave.  
Continue mode is disabled by moving the RIGHT DIFFICULTY switch to position A.

SAVEKEY AND ATARIVOX

A SaveKey (or AtariVox) can be used with this game to store the high score 
table.   Plug your SaveKey into the RIGHT CONTROLLER port before switching 
on the console.  If you do not have a SaveKey, then the game can be played 
normally, but the high score table will not be functional.  The game will be 
enhanced with speech if an AtariVox unit is used.

WARNING: Do not switch off the console or unplug the SaveKey immediately after 
entering your initials.  Doing so may cause the saved scores to become corrupt.
It is safe to switch off the console when the title screen is showing.  
To delete the saved scores, hold the joystick RIGHT and press FIRE during 
the AtariAge startup screen.
