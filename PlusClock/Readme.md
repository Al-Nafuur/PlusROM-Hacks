# PlusClock

The PlusClock ROM requests the current time from its PlusROM backend and displays it. The time is the local time of the server! The server in this example is CET (Central European Time).

The ASM code is basically Chris "Crackers" Cracknell's code from: https://www.biglist.com/cgi-bin/wilma/wilma_hiliter/stella/199710/msg00071.html
